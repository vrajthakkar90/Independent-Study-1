# Independent Study-1

This is a short report of Independent Study-1(semester long) about Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces. This project also marks my first public presentation in front of a panel of extremely good professors. I would like to thank my Mentor Prof. Aditya Tatu(Phd, University of Copenhagen) for guiding me throughout the project and introducing me to this feild. I really got the zeal to learn pure math from this project and we are continuing the project in semester 7, diving deeper into mesh deformation algorithms.
