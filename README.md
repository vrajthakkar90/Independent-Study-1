# Independent Study-1
This is a short report of Independent Study-1 about Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces. I would like to thank my Mentor for the project was Prof. Aditya Tatu(Phd, University of Copenhagen). I really got the zeal to learn pure math from this project and I credit a large amount of my interest in geometry to Prof. Tatu
